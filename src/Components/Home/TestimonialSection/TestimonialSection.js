                            â€œThe Red Owl Parenting Course not only taught me how to become a better parent, it taught me how to become a better person. The life lessons in this course are invaluable and should be recommended to all parents. I thought I knew what it meant to be a dad, but there were so many opportunities for my personal growth. Thank You Red Owl!"
